# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition


In this project we have used The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

We have used a fully connected sequential model from scikit-learn to train our data set and further we have evaluated how much the model is capable of recognizing handwritten digits using different python libraries.
